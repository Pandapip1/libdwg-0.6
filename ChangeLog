	- Broken with large R2004 files (uint16_t Dwg_Section.address ??).

	Release 0.5 alpha (lib version 3:0:0)
	* Fixed:
	- Reseting entities and nongraphs before attempting to decode them, so
	  that automatic memory sanitization do not crash freeing non-allocated
	  non-null pointers.
	- dwg->num_classes = 0; after freeing a Dwg_Struct: avoids crashes when
	  reloading a new file.
	- Unknown bug blocked logging output to stderr through macros, using
	  functions now.
	- Showing common entity data from de dwg-dump program, it was missing.
	- Some fields from the "variables" spec was permuted.
	- SPATIAL_INDEX handle fields.
	- Checking for valid extended data in objects, even if not saving it.
	- Completed parsing of HATCH entities.
	- Man page for dwg-dump, now according to --help output.
	- dwg-dump now dumping variable type objects too.
	- dwg-dump: group-code 90 == class version.
	* Changed:
	- [API] variable's names now are according to DXF spec.
	- [API] DWG_SUPERTYPE_OBJECT ==> DWG_SUPERTYPE_NONGRAPH
	- [API] some nongraphs had 'parenthandle' as "parent" or "parent_handle",
	  now it is uniform: "parenthandle" only. And it was moved up one level,
	  as a general nongraph field.
	- [API] reactors and xdicobjhandle are common for entities and for
	- Program name "test" to "load_free" in the check subdir. This program
	  now loads multiple files, freeing the memory after decoding each one.
	- dwg-dump program updated according to API changes.
	  nongraphs, so they were moved up a level, as object fields.
	* Added:
	- [API] [NEW] Entity WIPEOUT.
	- [API] Message fifo to store errors, the messages are poped with a user
	  visible function.
	- [API] Absolute handle retriever (dwg_handle_absolute).
	- dwg-dxf program, it converts a DWG file to a DXF one, version R2000.
	- dwg-preview program, it shows raw bit-map data, unknown format, for
	  now only ASCII art of it.
	- Memory tracing in the check subdir: no memory leaks.
	- Doxygen configuration file in doc.
