LibDWG is a free C library to read DWG files.  It is licensed under the terms
 of the GNU General Public License version 3 (or at your option any later version).

DWG is a file format created in the 70's for the emerging CAD applications.
Currently it is the native file format of AutoCAD, a proprietary CAD program 
developed by AutoDesk.

LibDWG is a re-fork from LibreDWG due to its freezing state. Original LibDWG 
paused since June 2009, it was written using Esperanto, but from September
2003 its development got in the run again, in English.  At this moment the 
decoder is not extensively tested.  It reaches 97% read support in the data
structures parser and still needs a test suite.  An utility application is
available, it is a dumping program: dwg-dump.

== Building and installing the library ==

See INSTALL for generic instructions.  Basically, you do:

$ ./configure [options]
$ make
$ make check    # optional but strongly encouraged
$ make install

This builds and installs various files in the "installation dirs":
  $libdir     ($exec_prefix/lib)   -- library files (libdwg.*)
  $includedir ($prefix/include)    -- dwg.h

Use "./configure --help" to see a full list of options you can use to
customize the installation dirs.  Other options recognized by configure are:

  --disable-trace

    Disable runtime tracing (default: enabled).  When enabled, the environment
    variable LIBDWG_TRACE is consulted on the first decode attempt.
    Its value is an integer: 0 (no output) through 9 (full verbosity).

== Example usage of the library ==

The check directory contains an application code that links with libdwg:

* load_free.c -- This is a skeleton code.  Look there if you want to have a
  quickly glance on how to use the library.

The programs directory contains utilities that uses libdwg:

* dwg-dxf.c -- Opens a DWG file and converts it to a DXF one. It may be used as
  an example of how to use the library. Generates R2000 files.

* dwg-dump.c -- Opens a DWG file and outputs a text dump of its data. It is not
  useful as API usage example, it relies on some of libdwg's src files.

* dwg-preview.c -- Extracts the bmp thumbnail of a dwg file when it is 
  available. It does not give a normal bitmap file, just some kind of raw data
  not known yet.
